Visualization and data aggregation tool for benchmarking

This tool requires Qt 5 to build and run as well as a C++11 capable compiler.
The qhidapi adaptation of hidapi to a Qt interface is also required. It can be found at
https://github.com/mhaehnel/qhidapi

This uses a slightly adapted version of qcustomplot for graphic representation of data. The original
version can be found at https://gitorious.org/qcustomplot/
